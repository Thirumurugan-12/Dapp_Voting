This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run a decentralized voting application on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your system
- A text editor for code editing
- A private key for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

3. Install the required Node.js packages.

```bash
npm install
```

## Compiling and Deploying the Smart Contract

You need to compile and deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.

1. Compile the smart contract.

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

2. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network. Replace `volta` with your desired network.

```bash
npx hardhat run --network volta scripts/deploy.js
```

3. After deployment, copy the contract address.

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory.
2. Add your private key and contract address to the `.env` file.

```dotenv
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your-contract-address
```

3. Optionally, you can configure another blockchain's endpoint by modifying the `hardhat-config.js` file.

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

Access the decentralized voting application by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
